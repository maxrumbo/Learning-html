# Learning-HTML

This repository is a basic introduction to web development, focusing on fundamental concepts of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's designed for beginners to understand how these three core technologies work together to create simple interactive web pages.

---

## What You'll Find

This repository contains examples demonstrating:

* **HTML (HyperText Markup Language):** The basic structure and content of a web page.
* **CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):** How to apply styles, specifically changing text colors.
* **JavaScript (JS):** How to add interactivity, specifically creating a button that changes text when clicked.

---

## Project Structure

You will typically find one or more HTML files (`.html`), which may link to CSS files (`.css`) and JavaScript files (`.js`).

* `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure and content.
* `style.css`: (If applicable) The CSS file defining styles for the HTML elements.
* `script.js`: (If applicable) The JavaScript file containing the interactive logic.

---

## How to View

To view these examples, simply open the `.html` file in your web browser.

1.  Navigate to the project folder.
2.  Double-click the `index.html` file (or any other HTML file).
3.  Your default web browser will open and display the page.
